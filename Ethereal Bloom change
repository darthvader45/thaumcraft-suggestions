TheLordEternal has suggested this(I am only posting it here, all credit for the suggestion goes to him):

So hey, I've got an idea for making taint seem more "lively", By making taintacles start sprouting near the edges if you try to purify a patch of taint inside of a taint biome. Maybe even have Taint Swarms being attracted to areas being purified as well, Reacting to their presence like an immune-system.
They probably shouldn't destroy the flower though, As that would just make it a nuisance to use them.

(offshoot idea)
Unless of course, They kept growing as they purified, Absorbing the taint and using it as fuel for its growth. needing you to protect it only until its grown large enough.  I'd imagine that if that was the case though it'd purify/grow in pulses. Building up a internal charge before releasing it, Immediately purifying nearby taint instead of gradually over several minutes. And eventually it'd grow into a great tree (that maybe have unique properties or materials that could be harnessed?), Absorbing taint until there's nothing left then starving and withering. This withering could even release captured/purified Vis into the air as well?
